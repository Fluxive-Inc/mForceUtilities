// cluster SUPERUSER, so a missing variable did not fail — it quietly connected
// with more privilege than this service is meant to have, and segregation was
// decided by an environment variable nothing checked. It is also how a correct
// password still produces an auth failure, because the role is wrong.
// Production fails closed and names the variable. Development keeps today's
// behaviour with a warning, so nobody's local loop breaks over a variable that
// is only ever set in Cloud Run. Same shape as mForceBookkeeping's db/pool.js,
// which is the app that already had this right.

    // Cloud Run without ever setting NODE_ENV, so a NODE_ENV gate would take the
    // development branch on the very services it exists to protect. (The same hole
    // is in mForceBookkeeping's db/pool.js, which this helper is modelled on —
    // tracked as FPQ-18.) K_SERVICE is set by Cloud Run itself on every revision;
